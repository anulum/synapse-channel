# Troubleshooting

Symptom → cause → fix for the problems you are most likely to hit. Every message
quoted below is one the tools actually print, so you can match on it directly.

## `[NAME] Could not reach hub at ws://…`

The client could not open a WebSocket to the hub. In order of likelihood:

- **The hub is not running.** Start one — `synapse hub` (or `synapse team` for a hub
  plus workers). Confirm it is up with `synapse health` (exit `0` reachable, `1` not).
- **The `--uri` does not match the hub.** The default is `ws://localhost:8876`; if the
  hub runs on another `--host`/`--port`, pass the matching `--uri` to every client.
- **The port is taken or firewalled.** Start the hub on a free port
  (`synapse hub --port 8899`) and point clients at it.
- **It is a secured hub and you sent no token** — see [authentication](#a-secured-hub-refuses-me) below.

## A waiter exits at once, or seems to loop re-arming

`synapse wait` is a *one-shot* wake primitive — it is meant to exit and be re-armed:

| Exit code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `0` | a matching message arrived (it is printed) |
| `1` | the hub was unreachable |
| `2` | it waited the full `--timeout` and nothing arrived |
| `3` | the connection dropped while waiting — **re-arm, do not treat as an error** |

Re-arming on exit is normal. A *tight* re-arm loop almost always means you are being
woken by traffic that is not for you — see the next two entries.

## `[NAME] connection to ws://… closed; re-arm the waiter.`

Exit code `3`: the hub closed the connection (a hub restart, a name takeover, or a
network drop). This is expected — re-arm the waiter. A `--timeout 0` (indefinite)
waiter prints this instead of hanging on a dead socket, precisely so the caller
re-arms rather than going silently dark.

## I wake on messages that are not addressed to me

A `--directed-only` waiter wakes on a message addressed to **you**, to a **group glob**
you are in (`quantum/*`), a **CEO** message, or a **`--priority`** message. Routine
broadcasts to `all` are suppressed.

- **Since 0.42.0**, a priority or CEO message *directed at a different agent* no longer
  wakes you — it must still reach you (a broadcast, or one addressed to you).
- **On a multi-seat project**, arm the **seat** (`--for project/seat`) to wake only on
  seat-addressed traffic. Since 0.42.0 a message to the bare `project` is a routine
  project-level broadcast for a seat (it still reaches the seat's inbox, and a CEO or
  priority message still wakes it). Arm the **bare project** (`--for project`) — the
  default for the `syn-wait` wrapper — if you want project-level messages to wake you.

## Messages are in the feed but `syn-inbox` shows nothing

Two independent causes:

- **The inbox cursor is consume-on-read and shared.** `syn inbox` advances a per-project
  cursor; if a prior drain (a boot read, a wake handler) already passed those messages,
  a later read shows empty. Re-read against the raw feed (`~/synapse/feed.ndjson`) to
  recover them, or give each reader its own cursor file.
- **A reply went to a name outside your project namespace.** Project membership is the
  `project/id` **slash** form. A reply addressed to `project-keeper` (a **hyphen** suffix)
  is *not* in project `project`, so `syn inbox --project project` will not show it. Send
  as the bare project (`project`) or a slash sub-identity (`project/keeper`), not a
  hyphen-suffixed name, so replies route back to where you read.

## A name conflict, or my agent's own sends are refused

A waiter must not hold the **bare** identity it waits for: the bare name equals the
sender name, so a message to the project would evict the waiter. Arm it as `name-rx`
(the wrapper does this by default). A re-arming waiter *takes over* its own name,
evicting a ghost holder of `name-rx`; if a fresh send is refused with a name conflict,
another live connection already holds that name.

## A secured hub refuses me

A hub started with `--token <secret>` requires that token. Present it with `--token`,
`--token-file <path>` (so it is not visible in `ps`), or the `SYNAPSE_TOKEN` environment
variable — precedence is `--token` → `--token-file` → env. An unauthenticated socket gets
no welcome or roster and is closed after `--auth-timeout` seconds (default 10), so an idle
connection cannot sit on the `--max-clients` budget.

## `Could not acquire lock 'TASK': …` / `release refused for 'TASK': …`

- **Lock denied or timed out** — another agent holds the lease. Wait, coordinate, or
  raise `--timeout`. `synapse lock` serialises a command across agents by holding a lease
  for its duration.
- **Release refused** — you do not own that claim, or the hub did not answer. Releasing is
  idempotent; releasing something you do not hold is a no-op, not an error.

## A worker never replies on the channel

- Check the backend: `synapse worker --provider ollama --model <m> --base-url <url>`. For a
  no-network smoke test use `--provider rule` (deterministic canned replies).
- The model server (Ollama or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint) must be reachable at
  `--base-url`, and `--api-key-env` must name an environment variable that holds the key.
- A worker throttles itself with `--min-reply-interval`; it also ignores its own and
  service messages, so it will not answer presence or system traffic.

## `git error: …` on `git-claim` / `git-hook` / `git-release`

The git-aware commands resolve the branch and changed paths **client-side**, so run them
from inside a git working tree, on a branch. `synapse git-hook install` bakes the absolute
`synapse` path into the hook; pass `--synapse-bin` if it cannot be resolved from `PATH`.

## The hub refuses to start when bound off-loopback without a token

Binding `--host 0.0.0.0` (or any non-loopback address) **without** `--token` is **refused**,
not just warned about: the connection secret is the only thing standing between the channel
and the network, so the hub will not start unexposed by accident. Require `--token`, and if
you enable `--metrics`, require `--metrics-token` so the endpoint does not leak operational
metadata. To bind an unauthenticated off-loopback hub anyway (a trusted private network),
pass `--insecure-off-loopback` to downgrade the refusal to a warning.

## Still stuck?

- `synapse <command> --help` documents every flag.
- The [CLI reference](cli.md) and the [coordination model](coordination-model.md) cover the
  full surface and the concepts behind it.
